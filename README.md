# Algorithm
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ( listen) AL-gə-ridh-əm) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.

# Coding standards
Coding standards, sometimes referred to as programming styles or coding conventions, are a very important asset to programmers. Unfortunately, they are often overlooked by junior as well as some program developers due to the fact that many of the recommended coding standards do not actually affect the compilation of the code itself, a concept that we will focus on later. This report shall try to demonstrate the importance of coding standards, and why they have already become a common practice for businesses and programming language developers alike.

I shall begin with a definition of coding standards. In general they are a set of standards and guidelines which are/should be used when writing the source code for a program.  Standards are rules which a developer is expected to follow. However these rules, such as “the compiled file must have the extension .h” are often apparent are followed anyway. Guidelines however are much less well followed. They are stylistic measures which have no direct affect on the compilation of the guide, and exist only to make the source code more humanly readable. They are optional, but highly recommended. 

An important thing to remember about coding standards that many programmers seem to forget is that coding standards are not an abstract idea. In fact, for many companies and practically all programming languages, a coding standard is a physical document, and is vital for producing uniform code.
