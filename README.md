# Algorithm
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ( listen) AL-gə-ridh-əm) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.

# Coding standards
A coding standards document tells developers how they must write their code. Instead of each developer coding in their own preferred style, they will write all code to the standards outlined in the document. This makes sure that a large project is coded in a consistent style — parts are not written differently by different programmers. Not only does this solution make the code easier to understand, it also ensures that any developer who looks at the code will know what to expect throughout the entire application.

Coding standards are great — but how do you decide which standards you want to apply, and how they will be defined? When you formulate your ideal coding style, you should think about these points:

Can you actually read the code? Is it spaced out clearly?
Do you separate blocks of code into ‘paragraphs’ so that different sections are easily defined?
Are you using indentation to show where control structures (if, else, while and other loops) begin and end, and where the code within them is?
Are your variable naming conventions consistent throughout the code and do they briefly describe that data that they’ll contain?
Are functions named in accordance with what they do?
